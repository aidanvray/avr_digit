            <quote source="Beatles">“It was twenty years ago today/Sergeant Pepper taught the band
                to play..."</quote>. Actually, it was <duration quantity="21.5" unit="year">
                <!-- avr: quotation marks missing from attributes --> 21½ years ago today</duration>
            that <persName>Jon Bosak</persName> pulled together the original <orgName>XML Working
                Group</orgName>. But yes, it was <event>on <date when="1998-02-10">
                    <!-- avr: equal sign missing from attribute --> February 10, 1998</date> that
                    <codeSpec>XML 1.0</codeSpec> was released to the world</event>. Which is worth
            talking about. </p>
        <!-- avr: p had no close tag -->
        <p>It turns out that if you follow the pointers back, the original <codeSpec>XML 1.0
                Specification</codeSpec>
            <!-- avr: slash was in wrong part of close tag --> is still out there &amp; <!-- avr: naked ampersand -->
            <rs type="person" ref="Bray_Tim">my fingers</rs>
            <!-- avr: missing slash from close tag --> were the last to touch that document. The
            history of how XML came to be has been told at great length elsewhere, as have the
            details about <date when="1998-02-10">that February 10th</date>, so there’s no need to
            revisit.</p>
