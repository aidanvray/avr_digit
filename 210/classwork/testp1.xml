            <line>The continent of <continent name="Fodlan">Fódlan</continent>, said to be protected
                by a revered goddess, has existed since time immemorial. Three ruling powers now

                family and its knights.</line>
            <line>To the east, a league of nobles that heeds no king nor emperor rules what is
                called the <nation name="Leicester Alliance">Leicester Alliance</nation>.</line>
            <line>Once consumed by a tempest of war and turmoil, <continent name="Fodlan"
                    >Fódlan</continent> and these three mighty powers now exist in relative
                harmony.</line>
